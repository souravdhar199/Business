# Small Business

This program is made for small business owner to keep track of their weekly sales and labor cost.
The language that I used is Java.
At first the program will calculate the labor cost by collecting employees name, total weekly hour that they worked, and their hourly rate.
Type yes to add another employee.
If you type no it will collect all the data that you typed and calculate the total employee cost. Also it will print the employee name and their weekly hour and their rate.
Also it will print the total employee that worked. And then it will print the total hours that all employee worked.


After that it will calculate the total sale by colecting the product name and the price of the product from user.
Also it will show the summary of sales.

 For clear understanding of this program, I added a video on this project you can downlaod this and watch it, It ill show the output of this program.(The first File)
